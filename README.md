# ArrowConnect

Basically probably maybe endorsed by the National Chair of the Order of the Arrow:
"One of our goals is to have an app...that puts everything you need at your fingertips."

### A very rudimentary concept for an Order of the Arrow application for all members at all levels to address the current fragmentation and lack of accessibility of OA tools.

### Created by Kaveer Gera for the 2022 National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) Hackathon.
